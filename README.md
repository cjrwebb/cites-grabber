# cites-grabber

This `RShiny` app can be used to display a graph of cumulative and yearly Google Scholar citations using the `scholar` package. The interface allows users to enter a 12-character Google Scholar ID to fetch and display work in a table format. The app cannot be deployed to a Shinyapps.io server, and only works locally.
